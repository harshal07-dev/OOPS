1. what do you mean by OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)?
   is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concepts of "objects", instead of focusing primarily on the functions or procedures.

2. core principle of OOPS are :-

- Encapsulation - reduce complexity & increase Reusability
- Abstraction - reduce complexity & isolate impact of changes
- Inheritance - Remove duplicate codes
- Polymorphism - refactor ugly switch/cases statements

3. Benefits of OOP

- Modularity
- Reusability
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Abstraction and Encapsulation
- Flexibility through Polymorphism
